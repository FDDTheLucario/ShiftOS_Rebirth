		"One: Terminal command syntax.",
		"Inside ShiftOS, the bulk of your time is going to be spent within the Terminal.",
		"The Terminal is an application that starts up when you turn on your computer. It allows you to execute system commands, open programs and control your system.",
		"To enter commands into your terminal, simply type in the user who created the command's name, a.k.a it's \"namespace\", followed by a period (.) followed by the command's name.",
		"For example, sos.help.",
		"If you would like to specify command parameters, you can do so by entering a set of curly braces {} after the command name.",
		"An empty set of curly braces, or none at all, means no parameters. However, if you'd like to send a parameter, inside the curly braces, type the parameter name",
		"followed by a colon (:) and then the value.",
		"There are various value types you can use:

 - Booleans ({key:true, key2:false})
 - Integers ({number:123}) - Note that integers have a maximum value of 2.4 billion.
 - Strings ({key:\"value\"})
 - Objects ({key:{key2:\"value\"}})
 - Arrays ({key:[\"element 1\", \"element 2\"]})",
		"For example, I can do win.open{app:\"pong\"} to open the Pong application from the Terminal.",

		"It costs 50 Codepoints. You may buy it using the codepoints you have been given, or you can try and earn your own Codepoints using pong.",
		"But be careful, it's best to buy things that can give you even more Codepoints...",
		"because when you run out and can't make any more.... you're stuck with what you've got.",
